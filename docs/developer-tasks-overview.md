# DataCloak Multi-Field Sentiment Analysis - Developer Tasks Overview

## Project Summary
Transform DataCloak from single-field to multi-field sentiment analysis with automatic column discovery using ML+Graph algorithms, parallel processing, and maintained performance for 20GB+ files.

## Development Team Structure

### 4 Developers with Specializations:
1. **Dev 1 - ML/AI Engineer**: Column profiling, ML classifier, feature extraction
2. **Dev 2 - Systems Engineer**: Graph algorithms, parallel processing, performance optimization  
3. **Dev 3 - Backend Engineer**: Service API, data models, streaming infrastructure
4. **Dev 4 - Integration Engineer**: CLI updates, testing framework, monitoring

## Timeline: 15 Days (3 Sprints)

### Sprint 1 (Days 1-5): Foundation & Column Discovery
- ML classifier integration
- Feature extraction pipeline
- Basic graph construction
- Multi-select UI components

### Sprint 2 (Days 6-10): Core Processing & Estimation
- Graph ranking algorithms
- Parallel processing pipeline
- ETA estimation engine
- Checkpoint/recovery system

### Sprint 3 (Days 11-15): Optimization & Integration
- Performance optimization
- Integration testing
- Documentation
- Deployment preparation

## TDD Approach
All developers will follow strict Test-Driven Development methodology:
1. Write failing tests first (Red)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor for quality (Refactor)
4. One test at a time
5. Test behavior, not implementation

## Success Metrics
- Profiling Speed: <10 seconds for 1000 columns
- ML Classification: F1 ≥0.93
- Memory Usage: ≤1GB resident per 100MB processed
- ETA Accuracy: ±15% of actual runtime
- Test Coverage: ≥80% for all new code

## Deliverables Per Developer
Each developer will deliver:
- Working code with comprehensive tests
- Documentation
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration points
- Monitoring metrics
